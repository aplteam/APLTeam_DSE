# DSE

## General

This project needs Dyalog 18.2 Unicode or better; Classic is not supported.

18.2 and later versions copy from the WS `aplteam18.dws`; see `Setup.dyalog`. 

That WS is created by the following steps:

1. Open the project aplteam_dse with Cider

1. Ask Cider to print the "Make" expression to the session and then execute it

Which implies that all development is made in the project of course: _**don't** change anything in the workspace `DSE\aplteam18.dws`!_
