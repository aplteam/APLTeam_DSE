This namespace contains functions you might find useful in one way or another.

Use ∆List to produce a list of all of them.

Note that after firing up an instance of APL this namespace appears to contain
not much more then README and ∆List, but once you call ∆List it will bring in
everything it finds in the Snippets\\ directory.
